Parameters vs Argument
Direct function execution and indirect function execution   
function.

console.dir(obj);
it takes in an object and spits out all the properties of that object

function is an object

STORING FUNCTION
storing function in the right side of our equals sign is special in javascript comes with different implications.
storing a function inside a variable does not hoist the function.

expressions r something that yields some value

FUNCTION DECLARATION VS FUNCTION EXPRESSION

function declartion get hoisted at the top and initialized, thus u can use it in the lines before the declaration
function expressions get hoisted but not initialized/defined. so u can't use them. function expression is better practice but not strict.

6.8 ANONYMOUS FUNCTION
anonymous functions often used as callback, do not have a name. and that is bad, because if u r running a huge script and that script is an optimized version, then that'll be hell.

On methods on a primitive
str = 'Hello world'
str.toUpperCase(). what's STRANGE here? well, str is a string but it has a method, toUpperCase() and primitives don't have methods, objects do.

On return
The return stops the execution of a function and returns a value or maybe nothing

11. ARROW FUNCTIONS

what u can do is write single line function without using return
if there is no argument add the parentheses, if there is just one argument, remove them
